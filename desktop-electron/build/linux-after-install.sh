# Sets the SUID root bit on chrome-sandbox so Electron's sandbox helper
# can elevate as required. Without this, Electron crashes on close (and
# on first sandboxed renderer launch on some configs) — issue #395.
#
# Why it's needed: Electron's setuid sandbox is the supported sandboxing
# path on Linux when unprivileged user namespaces aren't available. Newer
# Ubuntu (24.04+, definitely 26.04 LTS) ships AppArmor + kernel hardening
# that disable unprivileged user namespaces by default, so the SUID path
# becomes mandatory.
#
# This matches the postinst behaviour of other Electron apps (VS Code,
# Slack, Discord, Signal, etc.). electron-builder doesn't ship this by
# default — it has to be wired up via {deb,rpm}.afterInstall.
