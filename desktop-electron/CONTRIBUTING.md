# Contributing to Hermes Desktop

Thanks for your interest in contributing to Hermes Desktop! Whether it's a bug fix, a new feature, improved docs, or just a typo — every contribution helps.

## Languages

## Getting Started

1. **Fork** the repository and clone your fork locally.
2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the app in development mode:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Making Changes

1. Create a new branch from `main`:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b your-branch-name
   ```

2. Make your changes. Keep commits focused — one logical change per commit.

3. Run checks before submitting:

   ```bash
   npm run lint
   npm run typecheck
   ```

4. Test your changes locally with `npm run dev` to make sure everything works as expected.

## Submitting a Pull Request

1. Push your branch to your fork.
2. Open a pull request against `main` on the upstream repo.
3. Write a clear description of what you changed and why.
4. If your PR addresses an open issue, reference it (e.g., `Fixes #42`).

### Keep Pull Requests Small

Please keep PRs small and focused — they are much easier to review and merge. PRs that touch too many files or bundle unrelated changes will likely be asked for splitting up or may not be accepted.

- Stick to one logical change per PR (one fix, one feature, one refactor).
- If you find yourself touching many unrelated files, split the work into multiple PRs.
- Avoid bundling formatting/style sweeps with functional changes.
- Smaller PRs get reviewed and merged faster.

A maintainer will review your PR and may request changes. Once approved, it will be merged.
